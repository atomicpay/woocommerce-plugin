## Usage
Once activated, your customers will be given the option to pay via AtomicPay which will redirect them to AtomicPay checkout UI to complete the payment. On your WooCommerce backend, everything remains the same as how you would use other payment processors such as PayPal, etc. AtomicPay is designed to be an addtional option on top of the existing payment options which you are already offering. There will be no conflicts with other plugins.
